# Design Patterns in TypeScript

## Chapter 1: SOLID Principles

### Single Responsibility
A class should be responsible for a single part of the functionality

### Open/Closed Principle
Open to extension and Closed to modification

### Liskov Substitution
use a subclass in place of its parent class

### Interface Segregation
A class should not depend on methods that it does not need to implement

### Dependency Inversion
Classes and Modules should depend on abstractions instead of concrete implementations
